# Landscape2 settings
#
# This settings file allows customizing some aspects of the landscape.

# Foundation (required)
#
# Name of the foundation. This value is used in some labels, so we recommended
# to keep it as short as possible.
#
# foundation: <FOUNDATION_NAME>
#
foundation: CNCF

# Images (required)
#
# Urls some images used in the landscape UI.

# Categories (optional)
#
# Categories information is read from the `landscape.yml` data file. The way
# categories are displayed in the web application is computed dynamically based
# on the number of categories and subcategories, as well as the number of items
# on each. Sometimes, however, we may want subcategories to be displayed in a
# specific order within a category (this happens often in the Members category).
# In those cases, it is possible to define that order by overriding a category.
#
# This option can also be used to not display one or more subcategories in the
# landscape. To achieve that, we only need to exclude the subcategory from the
# subcategories list when overriding a category.
#
# categories:
#   - name: <CATEGORY_NAME>
#     subcategories:
#       - <SUBCATEGORY1_NAME>
#       - <SUBCATEGORY2_NAME>
#

  color6: "rgba(0, 42, 81, 0.7)"

# Featured items (optional)
#
# This section allows highlighting items that match certain criteria. You can
# define a list of rules and the matching items will be featured in a special
# way in the landscape.
#
# Each rule must define a field for the check as well as the values that will
# trigger a match. At the moment the fields supported are:
#
#   - maturity
#   - subcategory
#
# When a given item's field matches any of the values provided, it will be
# considered a featured item. For each option, it is possible to also define an
# order (which item would be displayed first) and a label for the item.
#
# featured_items:
#   - field: subcategory
#     options:
#       - value: <SUBCATEGORY1_NAME>
#       - value: <SUBCATEGORY2_NAME>
#
featured_items:
  - field: maturity
    options:
      - value: graduated
        order: 1
        label: CNCF Graduated
      - value: incubating
        order: 2
        label: CNCF Incubating
  - field: subcategory
    options:
      - value: Platinum
      - value: Gold

# Grid items size (optional)
#
# Defines the preferred size of the landscape items in the grid mode. When the
# landscape contains many items, it is recommended to use the `small` size.
# However, if there aren't many items, choosing `medium` or `large` may make
# the landscape look nicer. Users will still be able to adjust the items size
# from the UI using the zoom controls.
#
# grid_items_size: <small|medium|large>
#
grid_items_size: small

# Groups (optional)
#
# In some cases, specially when a landscape contains lots of items, it may be
# interesting to organize them in groups. Each group will be displayed on a
# different tab in the landscape web application. Each entry must contain the
# name of the group (it will be displayed as is) and a list with the categories
# (as defined in the landscape.yml data file) that will be part of this group.
#
# groups:
#   - name: <GROUP_NAME>
#     categories:
#       - <CATEGORY1_NAME>
#       - <CATEGORY2_NAME>
#
groups:
  - name: Projects and products
    categories:
      - App Definition and Development
      - Orchestration & Management
      - Runtime

# Name of the members category (optional)
#
# Landscapes usually have a special category dedicated to the members of the
# corresponding foundation. It is possible to use any name for that category,
# but it is important that we define it here as there are some special
# operations that depend on it.
#
# members_category: <CATEGORY_NAME>
#
members_category: CNCF Members

# Social networks urls (optional)
#
# List of social networks urls that will be used to create some links in the
