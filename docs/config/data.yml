# Landscape2 data
#
# This file contains the data that will be used to generate the landscape. The landscape data is a
# collection of items organized into categories and subcategories.
#
# NOTE: to maintain backwards compatibility with the previous version of the landscape, the data
# file used by v2 is based on the format used by v1. There are some extra fields not available in
# v1, and it's likely that more will be added over time. Most of the fields supported by v1 should
# also be supported by v2, although there might be some exceptions.

# List of categories in the landscape (required) (this field can also be named `landscape`).
categories:
  - # Name of the category (required).
    name: My category
